        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
        You've got a <code>raw.github.com</code> URL that points to some work-in-progress HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. You'd like to share it with someone for a quick demo, or maybe you'd like to use it in a <a href="http://jsperf.com/">jsPerf</a> test.
        </p>

        <p>
        Too bad! Most things served from <code>raw.github.com</code> have a <code>text/plain</code> content type, which means HTML won't render, and some browsers won't execute JavaScript or apply CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>
        Delete the dot! Just replace <code>raw.github.com</code> with <code>rawgithub.com</code> and <em>skadoosh</em>, you're loading raw files from your GitHub repo and they're served with appropriate content types. Render HTML, apply CSS, execute JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Before</strong></p>
        <pre class="before">https://<strong>raw.github.com</strong>/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p><strong>After</strong></p>
        <pre class="after">https://<strong>rawgithub.com</strong>/user/repo/master/filename.js</pre>

        <p>
        It works with gists too! Just replace <code>gist.github.com</code> with <code>rawgithub.com</code> in the raw gist URL.
        </p>

        <h2>The Caveat</h2>

        <p>
        Use this for testing and for sharing demo code with friends, but <strong>don't use it for anything production-related</strong>. It's slow, it might break from time to time, and it's intended as a convenience for development, not free static hosting.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you send production traffic to rawgithub.com, evil things will happen to your site. You've been warned!
        </p>

        <h2>The Source</h2>

        <p>
        The source code for rawgithub.com is <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/rawgithub">hosted on GitHub</a>! Fork it and go nuts.
        </p>

        <h2>The FAQ</h2>

        <h3 id="can-i-use-rawgitub-in-production"><a href="#can-i-use-rawgithub-in-production">Can I use rawgithub.com on a production website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        No. Don't do this. Not even a little bit. It will make me very sad.
        </p>

        <p>
        rawgithub.com is a free service to make developers' lives easier when developing and testing and debugging things. It's not free hosting. Use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for that.
        </p>

        <h3 id="what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole"><a href="#what-will-happen-if-im-an-asshole">What will happen if I hotlink to a rawgithub.com URL on a production
            website?</a></h3>

        <p>
        If you hotlink to a rawgithub.com URL on a site that gets lots of traffic, requests will be throttled. If this heavy traffic continues, requests originating from your site will eventually be dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
        If the traffic continues even after automatic throttling is triggered, rawgithub.com will start serving <a href="/js/evil.js">evil.js</a> and <a href="/css/evil.css">evil.css</a> instead of requested JS and CSS files. Visitors to your site may see an alert warning against using rawgithub.com in production, and your JS may start doing very strange things.
        </p>

        <h3 id="google-webmaster-central"><a href="#google-webmaster-central">I tried to claim a rawgithub.com URL on Google Webmaster Central and rawgithub.com returns a 403 error instead of my verification HTML. What gives?</a></h3>

        <p>
        You can't claim rawgithub.com URLs on Google Webmaster Central, because rawgithub.com isn't a hosting service. It would be pointless anyway, since all rawgithub.com responses include an <code>X-Robots-Tag: none</code> header, which tells search crawlers not to index anything.
